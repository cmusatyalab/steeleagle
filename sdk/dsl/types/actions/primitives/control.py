"""Used for low-level control of a vehicle.

This service is hosted by the driver module and represents the global
control interface for the vehicle. Most methods called here will result
in actuation of the vehicle if it is armed (be careful!). Some methods,
like TakeOff, may take some time to complete. For this reason, it is
not advisable to set a timeout/deadline on the RPC call. However, to
ensure that the service is progressing, a client can either check
telemetry or listen for `IN_PROGRESS` response heartbeats which are
streamed back from the RPC while executing an operation.

Attributes:
    STUB (control_service_pb2_grpc.ControlStub): stub that is automatically set at runtime so that actions
        for this service can connect to gRPC
