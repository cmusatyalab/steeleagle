# control

Used for low-level control of a vehicle.

This service is hosted by the driver module and represents the global
control interface for the vehicle. Most methods called here will result
in actuation of the vehicle if it is armed (be careful!). Some methods,
like TakeOff, may take some time to complete. For this reason, it is
not advisable to set a timeout/deadline on the RPC call. However, to
ensure that the service is progressing, a client can either check
telemetry or listen for `IN_PROGRESS` response heartbeats which are
streamed back from the RPC while executing an operation.

## <><code class="docs-class">class</code></> SetGlobalPosition

*Inherits from: <code><Link to="/sdk/python/steeleagle_sdk/api/base#class-action">Action</Link></code>*

Order the vehicle to move to a global position.

Causes the vehicle to transit to the provided global position. The vehicle
will interpret the heading of travel according to `heading_mode`:
- `TO_TARGET` &#8594; turn to face the target position bearing
- `HEADING_START` &#8594; turn to face the provided heading in the global position object. 

This will be the heading the vehicle maintains for the duration of transit. 
Generally only UAVs will support `HEADING_START`.

The vehicle will move towards the target at the specified maximum velocity 
until the vehicle has reached its destination. Error tolerance is determined 
by the driver. Maximum velocity is interpreted from `max_velocity` as follows:
- `x_vel` &#8594; maximum _horizontal_ velocity
- `y_vel` &#8594; ignored
- `z_vel` &#8594; maximum _vertical_ velocity _(UAV only)_

If no maximum velocity is provided, the driver will use a preset speed usually 
determined by the manufacturer or hardware settings.

_(UAV only)_ During motion, the vehicle will also ascend or descend towards the 
target altitude, linearly interpolating this movement over the duration of
travel. The vehicle will interpret altitude from `altitude_mode` as follows:
- `ABSOLUTE` &#8594; altitude is relative to MSL (Mean Sea Level)
- `RELATIVE` &#8594; altitude is relative to take off position

## <><code class="docs-class">class</code></> SetVelocity

*Inherits from: <code><Link to="/sdk/python/steeleagle_sdk/api/base#class-action">Action</Link></code>*

Order the vehicle to accelerate to a velocity.

Causes the vehicle to accelerate until it reaches a provided velocity.
Error tolerance is determined by the driver. The vehicle will interpret 
the input velocity according to `frame` as follows:
- `BODY` &#8594; (`x_vel`, `y_vel`, `z_vel`) = (forward velocity, right velocity, up velocity)
- `NEU` &#8594; (`x_vel`, `y_vel`, `z_vel`) = (north velocity, east velocity, up velocity)
