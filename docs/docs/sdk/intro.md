# Introduction

The SteelEagle SDK allows developers to build new tasks, drivers, and more for the SteelEagle ecosystem. It is
primarily built for Python, though it supports all languages via its native Protobuf API. To help test applications,
SteelEagle provides a simulated environment which can end-to-end test missions using virutal kinematic vehicles.

## Contents
- [**Developer Guides**](guide/): Step-by-step development walkthroughs for all parts of the SteelEagle ecosystem
- [**Python Package**](python/): PyPI package containing SteelEagle SDK sources for Python
- [**Native Sources**](native/): Protobuf specification for the SteelEagle protocol (useful for non-Python applications)

### See Also
For a breakdown of SteelEagle's architecture, check out the [reference section](/reference/intro). New developers should
read through that documentation before attempting to write new modules.

## Requirements

SteelEagle was written and tested in Ubuntu Linux 24.04. It is recommended you develop in a Linux environment.
The project theoretically supports, but is untested, on Mac and Windows.
