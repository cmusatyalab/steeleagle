# Introduction

The SteelEagle SDK allows developers to build new tasks, drivers, and more for the SteelEagle ecosystem. It is
primarily built for Python, though it supports all languages via its native Protobuf API. To help test applications,
SteelEagle provides a simulated environment which can end-to-end test missions using virtual kinematic vehicles.
